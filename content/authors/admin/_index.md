Hi and welcome! I am a Ph.D Candidate at the University of Pittsburgh. My dissertation explores the causes and consequences of candidates with low democratic commitment on developing democracies. I am currently on the job market looking for an academic/research position.

I have  published in *Comparative Politics Studies*, and peer-reviewed journals in Latin America such as Revista de Ciencia Política-Chile. I am from Peru, where I taught classes on statistics and methodology at the Pontificia Universidad Católica, and University Antonio Ruiz de Montoya.
