**DecidebienPe** is an initiative that aims to improve the linkage between Peruvian citizens and their parties and representatives. Started with an application that reduced the time and cognitive burden of process candidates' information in the 2020 congressional elections. 

Thanks to the help of different organizations and volunteers DecidebienPe have developed and promote different applications that use technology and data so citizens can demand  government's accountability
