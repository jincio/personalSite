abstract: "The popular Peruvian saying that “one suffers, but enjoys” summarizes the year 2017 nicely. The year saw numerous social, political, and economic difficulties in Peru. The incumbent government had to face the ravages of El Niño, ministerial crises, and vacancy requests, among other things, while at the same time the economy was slowing down and poverty increasing. However, we believe that for most Peruvians, 2017 was also a joyous year, especially considering the agonizing classification of the Peruvian team in advance of the World Cup after 36 years of absence. In this article, we summarize the social and political context of 2017, focusing on the executive-legislative axis that determined the most important political events during the year of analysis.Esto es una prueba"
